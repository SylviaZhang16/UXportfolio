                <div class="content-flex">
                    <div>
                        <p>As China's socio-economic level continues to rise, so does the understanding of the function of sports. So far in 2018, the industry has entered a period of rapid development due to the continued promotion of policies and capital assistance.
                            <br>
                            <br>However, for young children aged under ten years old, unlike teenagers who can organize regular sports activities on their own, their physical education is still relatively absent. Parents and even teachers <span>lack knowledge of physical fitness for children</span>. It is becoming increasingly important to increase the accessibility and operability of theoretical and training programs for children's physical fitness.
                            <br>Another difficulty is the high-density nature of cities. <span>In urban communities, the space available for children to engage in physical activity is inadequate in terms of quality and quantity</span>.

                <p>Our group conducted a questionnaire survey for parents or prospective parents in Shanghai, which was conducted online in early 2021. 214 questionnaires were returned.
                <br>According to the analysis of the questionnaire, we concluded that there are several current problems of nowadays children's physical fitness training in the city.</p>

                <p>We selected <span>North Bund Region in Shanghai</span> as our target site. Because in this region, different types of old and new residentials are intertwined with each other. Therefore there is a rich foundation of interesting community, at the same time with a lot of <span>unused, fragmented activity spaces.</span></p>

                        <p><br>Based on the site problem, we defined the design concept of space installation, which is to adapt to the variable community available space area. 
                            <br>Afterward, we tried to investigate people's preferences for spatial installations and interactive elements in conjunction with modular illustrations. The modularization of spatial elements will also facilitates the next step of concrete design and practice, which ensures a faithful and stable representation of user choices.</p>

                        <p><br>Finally, we calculated the preference level of each factor and divided the results into three categories, "best", "average" and "poor". The table shows the results and the preference factors that should be taken into account and incorporated into the design of the interactive installation and application.

            <div class="h2-box">
                <h2>SporTetris - Modular Interactive installation design</h2>
                <p>According to the survey results, we found that people's choices tend to be diverse and personalized. Therefore, the overall design strategy of the space installation is to encourage people to choose freely according to their own or the community's actual situation. Modular technology thus provides an important basis for installations that can thus adapt and flexibly utilize a variety of narrow, unused activity spaces within the Shanghai community.</p>
                <p></p>
                <p><span>Scale</span>: All spaces are designed according to the scale of children, so that adults can enter but cannot stretch out, while children can run and play freely in it.
                <br><span>Spatial elements</span>: Tetris is used as the main form of the installation. Small units forms, such as climbing wall stirrups, flipping games, etc. come from traditional architectural forms such as doorways and stairs, leading children to unexpected spaces. The color scheme also fits the Tetris theme.</p>
                <div class="center">
                    <img src="images/project/sports/1.png"  width="1000" alt="design 1">

                </div>
                <p><span>Diversity</span>: Depending on different combinations, everyone can create multiple ways and paths to enter and exit the space on their own, refining the space to form different "difficulty levels". It allows children of different ages to freely choose and even change according to their abilities. While older children are climbing upwards in the installation, younger children are also enjoying themselves in the lower space.</p>

            <div class="h2-box">
                <h2>Application Design</h2>
                <p>Based on user research and questionnaire results, we found that users are very eager for professional guidance and courses on children's fitness. Also, due to the mobility and flexibility of the exercise devices, whether the devices are shared by the community or belonged to one family, the application can provide parents with <span>instructions and design guidance</span>.
                <br><br>In addition, when the device is managed by a community or educational institution, the application provides <span>a communication platform</span> and a common educational base between parents, teachers and community administrators.

                <h3 class="content">Playful Interface</h3>
                <p><p>From the above, it can be concluded that the key problems currently facing the community in the center of Shanghai are <span> insufficient space area and low quality</span> . Therefore, the application with the flexibility device can provide a large number of materials and combination suggestions to respond to different situations and shapes of available space.</p>
                <p></p>

                        <br>(1) Pre-design and trial before the user uses the device. 
                        <br>(2) After use, users provide feedback and suggestions to community or institution managers with the tools provided by the design system.</p>

                <h3>Differentiated User Flow</h3>
                <p>To encourage <span>parent-child interaction</span> and attract children's interest in physical fitness, I purposely designed <span>two versions of the user flow and corresponding interfaces</span>. 
                    <br>(1) The interface used by parents has a comprehensive management function, which can set exercise goals for children, assist in exercise clocking and monitor the course learning. Parents are also able to find suitable exercise places and devices in the surrounding community, and interact with the community and management through the platform to jointly promote the use of exercise devices.
                    <br>(2)The children's home page, on the other hand, presents several key features in a simple and vivid way, including the design system for fitness devices.  This hopes to enhance the fun of the whole exercise process and attract children with a game-like freshness.

                <h2>Conclusion & Reflection</h2>
                <p>As an educational platform, how can devices and apps increase parental autonomy and gain their trust in children's physical fitness and training? And when the equipment is owned by the community or sports organization, how can the app, as a communication platform, improve the voice of parents in their interactions with administrators and coaches? This is something to be explored.</p>
