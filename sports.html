                    <div>
                        <p>As China's socio-economic level continues to rise, so does the understanding of the function of sports. So far in 2018, the industry has entered a period of rapid development due to the continued promotion of policies and capital assistance.
                            <br>
                            <br>However, for young children aged under ten years old, unlike teenagers who can organize regular sports activities on their own, their physical education is still relatively absent. Parents and even teachers <span>lack knowledge of physical fitness for children</span>. It is becoming increasingly important to increase the accessibility and operability of theoretical and training programs for children's physical fitness.
                            <br>Another difficulty is the high-density nature of cities. <span>In urban communities, the space available for children to engage in physical activity is inadequate in terms of quality and quantity</span>.
                        </p>

                <p>Our group conducted a questionnaire survey for parents or prospective parents in Shanghai, which was conducted online in early 2021. 214 questionnaires were returned.

                <p>We selected <span>North Bund Region in Shanghai</span> as our target site. Because in this region, different types of old and new residentials are intertwined with each other.

                            <br>Afterward, we tried to investigate people's preferences for spatial installations and interactive elements in conjunction with modular illustrations. The modularization of spatial elements will also facilitates the next step of concrete design and practice, which ensures a faithful and stable representation of user choices.</p>

                <h2>SporTetris - Modular Interactive installation design</h2>
                <p>According to the survey results, we found that people's choices tend to be diverse and personalized. Therefore, the overall design strategy of the space installation is to encourage people to choose freely according to their own or the community's actual situation. Modular technology thus provides an important basis for installations that can thus adapt and flexibly utilize a variety of narrow, unused activity spaces within the Shanghai community.</p>
                <p></p>
                <p><span>Scale</span>: All spaces are designed according to the scale of children, so that adults can enter but cannot stretch out, while children can run and play freely in it.
                <br><span>Spatial elements</span>: Tetris is used as the main form of the installation. Small units forms, such as climbing wall stirrups, flipping games, etc. come from traditional architectural forms such as doorways and stairs, leading children to unexpected spaces. The color scheme also fits the Tetris theme.</p>

                </div>
                <p><span>Diversity</span>: Depending on different combinations, everyone can create multiple ways and paths to enter and exit the space on their own, refining the space to form different "difficulty levels". It allows children of different ages to freely choose and even change according to their abilities. While older children are climbing upwards in the installation, younger children are also enjoying themselves in the lower space.</p>
