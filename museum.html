                <H2>Problem Analysis</H2>
                <p>As a large country-owned museum, Shanghai Museum has explored the digitization of its collections and virtual exhibition to a certain extent. And its services are extensive and comprehensive, which shows its academic support and years of business accumulation.</p>
                <div cLass="center">

                </div>
                <p>However, there are several problem with the existing official websites and applications.
<br><span>(1) The key features and exhibition resources are not well connected through different screens and devices.</span> Users have to use all of them to receive the wanted service at the same time.
<br><span>(2)The current interface of exhibits information, 3D models and correspondingly virtual exhibition is immature and hard to use.</span> Also, they are not accessible on one certain mobile application.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="h2-box">
                <h2>Objective</h2>
                <p>I have reorganized the featuress and services of the Shanghai Museum which should satisfy what users expect from a mobile application. It should be able to provide a smooth one-stop experience, such as browsing information about exhibitions of interest - booking - guided tours in the museum.
                <br>The mobile app will also maximize the use of digital resources from the precious collection, providing both a preview before visiting and an online virtual exhibition feature for those who cannot get to the site.</p>

                <h2>User Persona</h2>
                <p>There are two types of target users, <span>in-person/local visitors and remote visitors</span>. They can share many resources on the one hand. On the other hand, they will differ in the second half of the experiential behavior process. In-person viewers are less dependent on the virtual exhibition interface, online audience, and vice versa.
                <br>However, it is worth noting that the two types of users are not fixed, but will <span>switch between each other</span>. Even those who can reach the site can make decisions by means of an online virtual preview. Therefore, the user profiles of Kristy and Micheal are summarized with these two categories as references.</p>

                    <p>Based the hand-drawn draft, I designed and connected low-fidelity wireframes.There are two key focus and user flow: 
<br><span>(1) Browsing exhibition information and finding dates for appointment.</span> I emphasize the information validity and completeness on the appointment page.
<br><span>(2) Using the in-museum map to navigate and provide exhibit information. </span>I strengthened the user-friendly,especially senior friendly operation, and the information sequence and attractiveness of the interface.</p>

                <h2>Conclusion & Reflection</h2>
                <p>1. Solid user research is crucial. Quantitative analysis can reveal users' tendencies through statistics, while specific interviews can reveal users' pain points in more detail, thus building a vivid user portrait. In this regard, we hope to do more comprehensive and in-depth in the future.
                  <br>2. How far can the museum's virtual tour be developed in the future, and can it be combined with Bluetooth, NFC, and AR/VR technologies to achieve better results?  With the accumulation of data accuracy and the development of technology, it may be possible to get a more realistic interactive experience through iteration.
                    <br>3. What will be the further connection between the physical exhibition space and the virtual web space? Will the physical exhibition space also change its shape as the user's viewing perspective shifts? I think this is a question that museums and art practitioners will continue to explore together in the future.</p>
